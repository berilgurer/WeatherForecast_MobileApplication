# WeatherForecast_MobileApplication
Project Overview:
WeatherMate is a mobile weather forecast application that provides real-time weather updates
and forecasts to users. The application will use a combination of GPS and user inputs to give
location-based weather information, including current weather conditions, hourly and daily
forecasts, and severe weather alerts. The app aims to help users plan their day-to-day activities
based on the weather conditions and avoid any potential weather-related hazards. The
expected results of this project are an easy-to-use and reliable mobile application that users can
use to stay informed about the weather.

Objective and Scope of the Project:
The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that provides accurate and
reliable weather information to users. The main targets of this project are:
● Develop a back-end application using Java Spring Framework and MongoDB database
that will include several API endpoints to fetch weather data from different sources.
● Create an Android mobile application with a maximum of 10 screens that displays
weather information in an easy-to-understand manner. The screens will include a home
screen with current weather information, hourly and daily forecasts, severe weather
alerts, a settings screen, and a search screen.
